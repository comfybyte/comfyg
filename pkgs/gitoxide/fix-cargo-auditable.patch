    fix: cargo-auditable build error
    
    Use `prodash` instead of `dep:prodash` in gix-features and `tracing`
    instead of `dep:tracing` in gitoxide-core.
    
    The `dep:mydep` syntax removes the implicit `mydep` feature for optional
    dependencies, this triggers a bug in cargo that affects
    `cargo-auditable`. See https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12336
    
    This affects some Linux distributions like NixOS which use
    `cargo-auditable` by default. Related issues:
